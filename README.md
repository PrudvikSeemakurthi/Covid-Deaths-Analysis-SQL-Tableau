## ❓ Problem Statement  
COVID-19 impacted millions globally, but raw datasets often lack clarity without proper analysis.  
This project seeks to answer:  
- Which countries and regions were most affected by deaths?  
- How did vaccination trends influence mortality?  
- What are the global vs. country-level differences over time?

## 🧮 Methods  
1. Loaded COVID-19 dataset into a SQL database.  
2. Queried data to calculate:  
   - Total cases and deaths.  
   - Death rate percentages by country and region.  
   - Vaccination progress vs. deaths.  
   - Rolling averages and time-based trends.  
3. Exported key outputs to Tableau.  
4. Built dashboards to visualize:  
   - Global and country-level trends.  
   - Interactive filters by region, date, and vaccination status.  
   - Comparative charts for deaths vs. vaccinations.  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Countries with low vaccination rates experienced higher death rates.  
- Developed nations showed faster vaccination rollouts, reducing fatalities.  
- Death peaks occurred in different waves, often lagging behind case peaks.  
- Regional disparities highlighted gaps in healthcare and vaccine access.
